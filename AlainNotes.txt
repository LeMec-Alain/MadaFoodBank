I need to create customer categories...And do all the maintenance of it...

I need to add a distribution tab in products and in there display my tool.
The tool will need to store stuff in the database...

I need to create more administrators groups and make sure I enforce the permissions

I need to do the front end...Make sure a user/customer is logged in...

In need to assign a customer a category

Should I generate templates for orders for each category? I think for now, it would be best...

Do the maintenance of Customer Categories...
===============================

Create a table
Create a controller
Create a model
Create a form
Create a language file
Do everything properly
Assign a customer to a category



In Customer Categories Controller...

He has 
	Construct
	Index
	Organize
	Process_organization
	Form
	Delete
What the fuck are those?

flash and data and redirect to stop people from refreshing re submitting...Really I would love to know how..

So, in index, he sets the Title from the language file
He gets all the categories
and loads the view passing the data
	Pretty standard stuff so what is the big deal?

The view is a list of all categories...

Need sting in language file for must select...
Organize corresponds to the tab?


Why am I loading Category Form what is that?

I need to create a file Customer_Category_Form


When I get logged out, the action still takes place and then I get redirected to login screen...Is that good or bad? I don't know


I do not get a confirmation when I add a Customer Category!

So I am doing ok with categories....
