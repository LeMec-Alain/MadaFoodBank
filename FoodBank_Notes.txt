=========


Implemented the ability to create Customer categories and to assign such a category(only one) to a customer.
	Notes: Need to make sure that only one can be checked at a time, although it now only stores the "latest/last" selected category.
	When editing, if nothing is checked, then the last selcted one is kept, which is ok sonce we need at least one category.
	When creating a new customer, we need to make sure(validation) that at least one category is selected.
	Need to provide the ability to add more information for each customer as per Mada needs.

	
Database changes are required for the above changes. A new filed in customer table along with a table to store all categories.
Need to create and edit language file for this...

Road Map: Continue improving and testing this feature...



Added distribution Tab to products

Solve the session login timeout stuff...

Make this database and code base version up to date(Database is the same...goCart3)

Should I redo the changes manually or simply copy the version?
I am not sure but I have to do it!!!


Take the repo version and do the Distribution tab for products!!! 
That will motivate you!!!!...
